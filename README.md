Getting a bit more understanding.

Keeping project light but adding as much complexity 
(boxes, flexbox, styling) down the road.

So far :
"Website" of 3 recipes :
Main page (playing with Flex)
The recipes pages would be the next steps?

As of 16/09/2022
Project : make pages more polished (CSS).
Try to implement JS behaviors (need ideas).
Thinking about making main page as a menu (a cartoonish/fun design).
