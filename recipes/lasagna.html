        <h4><u><strong>Description</strong></u></h4>

        <p>A recipe by Craig. His mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made from scratch tomato sauce and a delicious cheesy filling.

            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
